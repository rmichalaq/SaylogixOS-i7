## ðŸ“¦ Verify NAS UI & Functionality Final Specification

### 1. ðŸ§­ UI Structure Changes
- Replace the current card-style order list with a sortable **table layout**, matching the Inventory tab layout.
- Table headers should be sortable:
  - Order ID
  - Customer
  - NAS
  - Address

### 2. ðŸš« Remove Redundant Column
- **Remove** the `Action` column ("Verify" button per row).
- Clicking the entire row will open the right-side **drawer** with full address verification details.

---

### 3. ðŸ“‹ Drawer Behavior
When any row is clicked:
- Open the drawer from the right.
- Show:
  - Order Information (Order ID, Customer, Phone, NAS Code)
  - Original Address (raw fetched address)
  - Address Verification (as below)

---

### 4. âœ… Verification Output (Address Verification Box)
Show all available fields returned by the NAS API:
- `NAS Code`
- `Full Address`
- `Postal Code`
- `Additional Code`
- `Coordinates`
- `City`
- `District`
- `Street`
- `Building Number`
- `Unit Number`
- `Short Address`
- `Municipality`
- `Region`
- `Landmark` (if any)
- `Is Active` status (if available)

Add a validation layer: Highlight in red if any expected fields are missing.

---

### 5. ðŸ—º Location Preview
- Replace static "Map preview would be displayed here" with a **Google Maps embed**
  - Use coordinates (`lat`, `lng`) returned from NAS response
  - Display a red pin or location icon

---

### 6. ðŸ§  Functional Flow
- Clicking "Verify with NAS":
  - Call NAS API.
  - Display full returned data.
  - Store result in the following locations:
    - âœ… Add to `Verified Address Database`
    - âœ… Add the verified data into the current order object (`order.address_verified = true`, `order.verified_address = {...}`)
    - âœ… Tag the order with `NAS Verified` flag

---

### 7. ðŸ§¼ Remove Irrelevant UI Elements
- Remove `Verify Another Order` button.
- Verification is contextual to the specific opened drawer.

---

### 8. ðŸ“Š Top Metrics Boxes
(Keep for now, but make sure they update after each verification)
- Total Verifications
- Verified
- Pending
- Success Rate (%)

---
