🎯 Goal:
Fix the Shopify integration in SaylogixOS so that:
1. Admin API credentials can be securely configured per store.
2. Multiple Shopify stores can be connected.
3. Orders sync instantly using webhooks.
4. OMS (Orders screen) shows live Shopify orders instead of dummy data.

🔧 Tasks:

1. 🔐 Shopify Configuration Modal:
   - Add fields: Store Name, Admin API Key, Admin API Secret, Access Token.
   - Allow saving multiple Shopify stores (unique by store name).
   - Show existing credentials (masked).
   - Add "Test Connection" button to validate credentials.

2. 🌐 Backend API for Shopify Integration:
   - `POST /api/integrations/shopify/configure`: Save/store credentials securely.
   - `GET /api/integrations/shopify/test`: Connect to `/admin/api/2023-04/shop.json` to verify store access.
   - `GET /api/integrations/shopify/orders`: Fetch latest orders using `/admin/api/2023-04/orders.json`
   - `POST /webhooks/shopify`: Handle incoming order events (`orders/create`, `orders/updated`)
     - Validate using HMAC header.
     - Emit `EV001` or `EV003` events.
   - Store fetched orders in the backend and return via unified API for OMS.

3. 🔁 Webhook Auto-Registration:
   - After successful credential save, auto-register Shopify webhooks.
   - Topics:
     - `orders/create`
     - `orders/updated`
   - Endpoint: `/webhooks/shopify`

4. 🗺 OMS Frontend Update:
   - Replace dummy orders with data from `GET /api/integrations/shopify/orders`.
   - Add tab filters by order status:
     - Picking
     - Packed
     - Dispatched
     - Delivered
   - Each order row must show:
     - Saylogix Order ID
     - Shopify Order ID
     - Customer Name
     - Courier (if assigned)
     - Order Status (mapped from Shopify status)
     - Date Created

5. 🔁 Status Mapping:
   - Map Shopify statuses to internal Saylogix statuses:
     - `open` → `picking`
     - `fulfilled` → `dispatched`
     - `cancelled` → `cancelled`

6. 💻 Replit Notes:
   - Backend is in `/apps/backend`
   - Frontend is in `/apps/web`
   - Use existing eventBus to emit verification/status events (e.g., `EV001`, `EV003`)
   - Ensure Shopify integration card in UI shows:
     - Store name
     - Toggle status
     - Sync %, failure rate
     - Last 5 orders fetched

✅ Test with a real Shopify store and fetch order list.
