# 📦 SaylogixOS – Order Detail Page Redesign Prompt

## 🎯 Goal
Redesign the **Order Detail Page** to improve clarity, traceability, and UI alignment with modern order tracking standards. This will include a structured layout, key metadata, a detailed order timeline, and integrated tabs.

---

## 🧱 Page Layout Structure (Screen Components)

### 🔹 1. **Header Bar**
- Order ID
- Status badge (e.g., SHIPPED, DELIVERED)
- Action buttons: `Actions`

---

### 🔹 2. **Section: Order Details (Basic)**
- Order Source (e.g. Shopify, Zid)
- Order ID / Internal ID etc
- Created At timestamp
- Number of Items
- Ordered Quantity
- Payment Status (e.g., Prepaid / COD)
- Hub Name (e.g., SC01-KSA)
- Shipping Method / Courier Name

---

### 🔹 3. **Section: Customer Details (Card)**
- Name
- Contact Number
- Email

---

### 🔹 4. **Section: Shipping Address (Card)**
- Recipient’s Name
- Full Address (Street, City, Region, NAS)
- Country
- Phone Number
- Email

---

### 🔹 5. **Section: Shipment Details (Card)**
- AWB Number
- Suggested & Actual Courier
- Number of Packages
- Total Weight
- Delivery Status (Dropdown if needed)
- Insurance Status

---

### 🔹 6. **Section: SKU Details (Table)**
- Product Name / Image
- Barcode
- Batch Number
- Ordered Quantity
- Picked Quantity
- Expiry Date (optional)
- Total Cost per line

---

### 🔹 7. **Order Log → Rename to Order Timeline**
- Visual list showing timestamps for each stage:
  - Order Placed
  - Payment Confirmed
  - Picked
  - Packed
  - Dispatched
  - Out for Delivery
  - Delivered
- Each step includes timestamp + icon
- Add customer feedback block if available

---

## 🧭 Tabs Above Details (Optional Enhancements)
- `Item Details`
- `Order Timeline`
- `Returns & Incidents`

---

## 🔧 Replit Build Tasks
1. Create a `OrderDetail.vue` screen with clean layout based on above sections
2. Use tab layout at top for toggling `Item Details`, `Timeline`, etc.
3. Implement order timeline as a visual stepper component with timestamps
4. Fetch and display customer/order metadata in card layout
5. Ensure data structure supports multiple SKUs per order and shows their barcode + batch
6. Connect timeline data to backend event logs (e.g., picked, packed, shipped)

---

## 📁 Backend Notes
- Order timeline events should map to `event_id`, timestamp, actor (system/user)
- Store tracking history for transparency
- Order ID must link to source (Zid, Shopify, Noon, etc.)
- Ensure SKU-level details include batch, barcode, and expiry (if available)
