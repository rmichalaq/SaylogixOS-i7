### ◼ SAYLOGIXOS – FULLSTACK MONOREPO REPLIT PROMPT

> Copy-paste directly into Replit’s AI or dev onboarding instructions.

---

### 🔧 TECH STACK

- **Node.js + Express.js** (server logic)
- **React + TailwindCSS** (UI served by same app)
- **PostgreSQL** with Prisma ORM (DB layer)
- **event-driven** logic using `emittery`
- **REST APIs** + **webhook support**
- All in **one monorepo** — **NO separation** between frontend/backend

---

### 🛆 FUNCTIONAL MODULES (in scope)

1. **OMS** – Order ingestion, validation, prioritization, courier assignment
2. **NAS** – Address verification (Saudi NAS code), fallback to WhatsApp
3. **WMS** – Inbound, Putaway, Inventory, Picking, Packing
4. **DMS** – Dispatch grouping, real-time courier handover, manifest
5. **LMS** – Route assignment, driver app logic, GPS sync, delivery events
6. **Tracking** – Persistent buyer tracking link with milestone updates
7. **Reports & Analytics** – Operational dashboards and KPIs for order flow, courier performance, SLA adherence, and warehouse productivity

---

### 🔄 LIVE DATA POLICY (MANDATORY)

✅ Must connect to a **real Shopify store** using **Admin API** ✅ All fetched orders, SKUs, and inventory must be **live** ✅ All API integrations (courier, WhatsApp, etc.) must be **real** ❌ **Do NOT** use dummy data, fake JSON, or placeholder flows ❌ No mockup UIs — every feature must work with **production-grade** logic

---

### 🔔 WEBHOOKS (MANDATORY)

- Webhooks are **configurable under each specific connector** module.

  - Example: Shopify connector includes API credentials and its own webhook setup.
  - Aramex connector includes API credentials and its webhook/event sync settings.

- Shopify events (order creation, cancellation) must trigger internal Saylogix events

- Saylogix status updates must be **pushed back** to Shopify via **webhooks**

- Use real-time webhook handlers for:

  - `order_processing`
  - `order_picked`
  - `order_packed`
  - `order_shipped` (includes AWB)
  - `order_delivered`

- Shopify events (order creation, cancellation) must trigger internal Saylogix events

- Saylogix status updates must be **pushed back** to Shopify via **webhooks**

- Use real-time webhook handlers for:

  - `order_processing`
  - `order_picked`
  - `order_packed`
  - `order_shipped` (includes AWB)
  - `order_delivered`

---

### 🧱 ARCHITECTURE REQUIREMENTS

- Use **event-driven architecture** — all logic must run off event emissions
- Do **not** implement microservices or separate backend/frontend
- Use TailwindCSS to build **sleek, modern, minimal UI** — must impress customers
- Create **modules**: `/modules/oms.js`, `/modules/wms.js`, etc.
- Use tabs or routes to show OMS, WMS, DMS, etc. inside one React app

---

### 📦 DATABASE REQUIREMENTS

- Every order must store:
  - **Original order number** from source (e.g. Shopify)
  - **SaylogixOS internal order number** (format: `SLYY-<sequence>`)
  - **Timestamps** for all major processing steps:
    - order\_fetched
    - verify\_start / verify\_completed
    - order\_validated
    - order\_released\_to\_wms
    - picked
    - packed
    - dispatched
    - delivered
