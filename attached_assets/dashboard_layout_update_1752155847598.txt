# SaylogixOS - Dashboard Layout Update (Replit Prompt)

## Objective:
Rework the **Dashboard** layout to ensure:
- Consistent layout with the Inventory screen.
- Priority visibility of alerts.
- Modern, minimal, and action-oriented design.

## Instructions:

### 1. Critical Alerts Placement and Design
- **Position**: Move the `Critical Alerts` card section **above** the `Today's Load Summary` card.
- **Layout Matching**: Visually match the styling, border, and spacing of `Critical Alerts` with the existing `Today's Load Summary` component.
- **Responsiveness**: Ensure `Critical Alerts` adjusts responsively across all screen sizes.

### 2. Critical Alerts Component Behavior
- Display all alert cards in a **single row** (wrap on smaller screens).
- Each alert card includes:
  - Icon on the left.
  - Title in bold (e.g. "Orders Not Picked").
  - Subtext in lighter font (e.g. "Past SLA cutoff").
  - Red badge with count.
- Alert colors:
  - **Red** for SLA/picking/stock issues.
  - **Yellow** for API/system warnings.
  - Use clear iconography and uniform padding/margin.

### 3. Refactor Today's Load Summary
- Leave the `Today's Load Summary` exactly as is, but move it **below** `Critical Alerts`.
- Ensure proper margin/padding between both components.

### 4. General Dashboard Cleanup
- Remove Live Activity Feed unless there's real-time data to show.
- Make `Order Processing Performance` an expandable section that defaults collapsed.
- `Quick Actions` and `Recent Orders` remain at the bottom.

### 5. Mock Data Seeding
- Use mock data for all alert categories:
  ```json
  {
    "alerts": [
      {"type": "Orders Not Picked", "count": 3, "description": "Past SLA cutoff"},
      {"type": "Courier Failures", "count": 1, "description": "API not responsive"},
      {"type": "NAS Failures", "count": 2, "description": "Address verification"},
      {"type": "Out of Stock", "count": 5, "description": "SKUs with no inventory"}
    ]
  }
  ```
- Tag this mock seed as `DASHBOARD_MOCK=true` so it can be removed later.

### 6. Final UI Expectations
- Clean, aligned design following Inventory-style cards.
- Alert and load summary sections must be visible at first glance on page load.
- Mobile responsiveness must preserve card stacking and badges.

âœ… Once done, confirm that the `.env` contains a flag to remove seeded data later for production builds.
