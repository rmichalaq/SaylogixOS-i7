Refactor the Order Details drawer and backend logic based on the following changes:

---

### 🧾 ORDER DETAILS DRAWER (UX/UI)

1. ✅ **Fix Broken Buttons:**
   - 🛠️ `Edit Order` must open editable fields (customer name, phone, delivery address, items).
   - 🔁 `Change Status` must open a dropdown with valid statuses (fetched, picked, packed, dispatched, delivered, cancelled).
   - ❌ `Cancel Order` must trigger confirmation dialog and update status to `cancelled`.

2. 🧹 **Layout Cleanup:**
   Break the content into clear sections with spacing and alignment for readability:
   - **Order Summary**
     - Internal ID: `SL25-009`
     - Shopify Order #: `#1011`
     - Shopify Order ID: `6488575869155`
     - Order Value
     - Created Time
   - **Customer Info**
     - Name
     - Phone
     - Email (if present)
   - **Delivery Address**
     - Full address
     - NAS code (if available)
   - **Fulfillment & Courier**
     - Courier
     - AWB
     - Current status
   - **Actions**
     - Edit, Change Status, Cancel buttons

3. 🧭 Add subtle section dividers or horizontal lines between major sections for better legibility.

### 🔄 BACKEND LOGIC FIX – ORDER FETCHING

1. ✅ **Always fetch all orders from Shopify**, even if they have incomplete or invalid shipping addresses.
2. 🟨 Display such orders with:
   - Warning icon or yellow label: “⚠️ Address Missing”
   - Do not block their import or indexing.
   - Include them in status tabs and pagination.
3. 🧠 Backend should only **block courier assignment or dispatch** for those without valid delivery addresses — not block them from being fetched at all.

### 🛠 TECH DETAILS

- Shopify API: Use `GET /admin/api/2024-01/orders.json?status=any` to get all orders.
- Preserve original Shopify IDs for traceability.
- Add fallback when customer email is missing.

This will result in:
- A fully functional Order Details Drawer with proper interactivity
- Cleaner layout with improved usability
- A more robust and complete order sync pipeline
