Refactor the Orders (OMS) screen to improve usability, remove clutter, and enable richer order management. Apply the following changes:

---

#### 🧹 UI CLEANUP

- ✅ Remove the **"Sync Shopify"** button — no longer needed (sync is webhook-driven).
- ✅ Remove the **"Order Management"** header and description (“Manage and track all order fulfillment”).
- ✅ Move the **Filters** button **to the left** of the **Export** button (same row, right-aligned).

---

#### 📊 ORDER STATUS AS TABS

- Replace the **status filter** with **status tabs** above the table:
  - Tabs: `All`, `Fetched`, `Picked`, `Packed`, `Dispatched`, `Delivered`, `Cancelled`
  - Clicking each tab filters the visible orders by that status.

---

#### 🔢 ORDER DETAILS IMPROVEMENTS

- In the **Order Details** column:
  - Show both internal order ID (e.g. `SL25-014`)
  - And **Shopify order ID** (e.g. `#1017`)  
  - Also show **Shopify's original order number** (e.g. `Order: 4416357456871`) underneath.

#### 📦 ORDER DETAILS PAGE (On Click)

Enable **clicking an order row** to open a full **Order Details Drawer** or page view:
- **Sections to include:**
  - 🧾 Order Summary:
    - Internal ID, Shopify ID, Order value, Status, Creation Date
  - 👤 Customer Info:
    - Name, Phone, Email, NAS code (if available)
  - 📍 Delivery Address:
    - Full address, verified status, Google Maps preview (if integrated)
  - 📦 Ordered Items:
    - Table of SKUs, titles, quantities, unit prices, stock status
  - 🚚 Fulfillment & Courier:
    - Courier assigned (if any), AWB number, current stage, tracking link
  - 🛠 Actions:
    - ✅ Edit order (change items/quantities/address if not yet packed)
    - 🚫 Cancel order
    - 🔄 Change status manually

---

#### 🛠 TECH NOTE

- Use real data from Shopify, including:
  - Original order ID: `order.id`
  - Order number: `order.order_number`
  - Display internal SL25 format as `SL25-00X` based on import sequence

### 🎯 Objective

Create a modern, user-friendly OMS that gives warehouse teams full visibility and control over orders without needing to switch tabs or use external tools. Prioritize clarity and efficiency.
