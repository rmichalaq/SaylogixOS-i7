# Saylogix Settings Module - UI Layout Rework Instructions

## Overview
The Settings module must match the layout and user experience standards of the Inventory module—clean, tab-based, no KPI cards, and drawer-based interactions. This file describes the updated structure and behavior for each section.

---

## 1. General UI Guidelines
- No KPI cards on the Settings page.
- Use the same tabular layout and Action button positioning as Inventory.
- All interactions (edit/view) should open a right-side drawer.
- All drawers should contain logically grouped editable sections.

---

## 2. Primary Tabs
- Warehouse
- Users
- Clients

### 2.1 Warehouse Tab
- **Sub-tabs:** Removed
- Display: List of Warehouses / Hubs only
- **Action Button:** "+ Add Warehouse" (aligned right)
- **Click Behavior:** On clicking a warehouse card, open drawer with:
  - Zones
  - Locations
  - Packaging Material
  - Dock Settings

### 2.2 Users Tab
- **Sub-tabs:**
  - User Roles
  - Users
- **Action Buttons:**
  - In "User Roles": "+ Add Role"
  - In "Users": "+ Add User"
- **Click Behavior:**
  - Clicking a role → drawer opens with permission editing interface
  - Clicking a user → drawer opens with editable user details

### 2.3 Clients Tab
- **Sub-tabs:** Removed
- Display: List of client companies only
- **Action Button:** "+ Add Client" (aligned right)
- **Click Behavior:** Clicking a client opens drawer with:
  - Contract
  - SLA
  - Pricing
  - Suppliers
  - Connected Integrations
  - Shipping Rules

## Mock Data Seeding
- Seed the view with mock data to demonstrate functionality.
- Each warehouse/client/user/role must have enough attributes to populate the drawer with real examples.
- Prefix all mock data sources with `MOCK_` (e.g., MOCK_JeddahFC) for easy cleanup later.

---

## Design Consistency
- Match UI components (toggle, status chips, drawer spacing) to Inventory module.
- Consistent iconography and action positioning across all tabs.

---

## Acceptance Criteria
- No sub-tabs unless specifically defined above.
- All listed items must be clickable and drawer-enabled.
- Settings UI must be clean, minimal, and instantly understandable.
- No KPIs, charts, or statistics shown here.

This concludes the layout rework spec for the Settings module. Ensure this is implemented before moving to advanced configurations or automation inside drawers.
