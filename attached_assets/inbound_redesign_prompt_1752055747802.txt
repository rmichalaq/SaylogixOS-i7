# 📦 SaylogixOS – Inbound Processing Screen Redesign Prompt

## 🎯 Goal
Redesign the **Inbound Processing** screens in SaylogixOS for operational clarity, single-task flow, and optional action flexibility. Use this markdown to guide the Replit build. 

---

## 🧱 Main Tabs Structure (UI Navigation)

### 1. **Purchase Orders**
- Shows list of POs pending processing.
- Fields per PO row:
  - PO Number
  - Supplier
  - ETA
  - Status: (ASN ✅, Gate ⏳, Unloaded ❌)
- Click PO opens the **Inbound Flow Panel**.

### 2. **GRN**
- Filter Tabs: `Pending`, `Processing`, `Completed`
- Shows GRNs linked to completed inbound POs.
- Open GRN → scan and confirm quantities, log discrepancies.

### 3. **Putaway**
- Filter Tabs: `Staged`, `In Process`, `Completed`
- Operators pick tasks, scan cart, and confirm placements.

## 🧭 Inbound Flow Logic (Inside Purchase Order Detail View)

1. **ASN Panel (Optional)**
   - Add 1 or more Airway Bill numbers (multi-entry field).
   - Save button logs ASN with timestamp.

2. **Gate Entry Checkbox**
   - Clicking logs arrival time.
   - Read-only once set.

3. **Dock Assignment (Optional)**
   - Dropdown or skip button.
   - Auto-assign logic can be built later.

4. **Unloading Confirmation**
   - Tick box with optional comment (pass/fail visual check).
   - Once set → PO is moved to GRN queue.

---

## 🔄 Workflow Transitions
- If unloading is completed → create new GRN under `GRN > Pending`
- Once GRN is completed → auto-generate staged putaway task
- Putaway completion closes the inbound lifecycle

```

## 🔧 Replit Tasks
1. Build new `Inbound.vue` (or `Inbound.tsx`) screen with 3 main tabs
2. Add conditional logic panel when PO is clicked (step-based)
3. GRN and Putaway views should behave like status filters
4. Mermaid chart can be included in Help/Docs tab for reference
5. Optional: add event hooks for `gate.entry.marked`, `unloading.done`, `grn.completed`, `putaway.completed`

---

## 📁 Backend Notes
- Each action should log timestamps for traceability
- Use `po_id`, `grn_id`, `putaway_id` to link lifecycle steps
- Actions should trigger `event bus` messages for downstream modules
