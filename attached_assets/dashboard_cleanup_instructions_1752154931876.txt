## Saylogix Dashboard Cleanup Instructions (.md for Replit)

### Objective
Clean and modernize the Saylogix Dashboard so it behaves as a control center with alerts, volume stats, real-time updates, and actionable insights. Eliminate visual clutter and non-critical information.

---

### ✅ What To Display

#### 🔔 Critical Alerts Panel (Top Left)
**This must always be visible, red/yellow coded and refreshed live:**
- `# of Orders Not Picked` past cutoff (highlight SLA violation)
- `# of Courier Failures` (pickup not confirmed, API not responsive)
- `# of NAS Address Failures`
- `# of SKUs with No Stock`

#### 📊 Today’s Load Summary (Top Center)
Display the day’s operational volume across key zones:
- **Orders to Fulfill Today**
- **Pickups Scheduled**
- **Last Mile Routes Created**
- **Manifests Generated**

#### 🧠 Live Activity Feed (Center Panel)
Replace "no recent activity" with actual timeline feed:
- `User Ali scanned SKU-001 for Order SL25-030`
- `Tote T-045 dispatched from Jeddah FC to Riyadh Hub`
- Include timestamp and user info

#### 🧭 Upcoming Actions (Bottom Panel)
Use cards for upcoming work:
- `Next Pickups (list by courier)`
- `Pending Manifests`
- `Routes Missing Courier Assignment`

---

### 🧹 What To Remove or Move

- ❌ “+12% from yesterday” stats: not actionable
- ❌ “Quick Actions” box → move these to Settings sidebar or sticky FAB (floating action button)
- ❌ “Order Processing Performance” → replace with actual visualizations only if they show delay heatmap or SLA breach graph

---

### 🧪 Mock Data Seeding
Use mock seed entries for visual testing:
- Orders: `MOCK_Order_001` to `MOCK_Order_020`
- Users: `User_Ali`, `User_Sara`
- Couriers: `MOCK_Flow`, `MOCK_Aramex`
- Tote movements, dispatches, address failures

> 📝 Add `"source": "MOCK_Dashboard"` to DB entries for easy removal

---

### 🧩 Future Enhancements (optional)
- Add tabs for: **Operations / Exceptions / Courier Failures**
- Integrate graphs powered by real data (if performance allows)
- Filter feed by warehouse (if multiple FCs exist)

---

### Final Note
**Keep it modern, light, sharp.** 
The user must know in 5 seconds what needs their attention and what today’s volume looks like.

Use Inventory layout as the design baseline.
