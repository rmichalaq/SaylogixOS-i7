# 📦 SaylogixOS – Packing Screen Redesign & Logic Spec

## 🎯 Objective
Redesign the **Packing Module UI and Logic** to support efficient packing operations, including support for both manual and scan-triggered flows, automatic AWB generation/printing, and historical reprint access.

---

## 🧱 Layout Overview: Three Main Tabs

### 🔹 1. Packing Queue
- List view of **orders ready for packing**.
- Display per order:
  - Order Number, Customer Name, Priority (low/normal/high/urgent), and Order Value
- Clicking on an order loads a **packing panel** on the right:
  - Select Packaging Type (dropdown)
  - Input fields for weight
  - `Complete Packing` button → triggers label generation and print
  - `Print Label` button (optional)

---

### 🔹 2. Pack Orders (Auto-Scan Mode)

#### 🔸 Scanner Input Field (universal)
- Accepts either **SKU Barcode** or **Tote ID**
- Behaviors:

##### 🔹 If SKU Barcode is Scanned:
- System searches unpacked single-SKU orders.
- Picks the **oldest matching order**.
- Loads order detail: list of expected items.
- User scans the item again to **confirm** packing.
- Once the last expected item is scanned:
  - AWB is auto-generated.
  - Label is printed **automatically**.
  - Screen resets to next scan.

##### 🔹 If Tote ID is Scanned:
- System loads the full order mapped to the tote.
- User scans **each item in tote** to confirm correctness.
- When all expected SKUs are scanned:
  - AWB is auto-generated.
  - Label is printed **automatically**.
  - Returns to scan field.
  - Tote released into pool of totes used for picking.

---

### 🔹 3. Completed
- List of all recently packed orders.
- Clicking an order allows:
  - View packed contents
  - Reprint AWB label (manual trigger)

---

## 🔁 Functional Rules & Logic

- SKU barcode scan triggers single-order search by oldest first
- Tote scan links to pre-assigned order from picking
- All items must be scanned individually to confirm
- AWB generation and label printing is fully **automatic** upon scan completion
- System resets scanner focus after each packing is finalized

---

## 🔧 Backend Requirements

- API to match SKU → oldest unpacked order
- API to fetch tote → assigned order and items
- Event trigger for `packing.completed`
- Auto-generate AWB using courier API upon last scan
- Trigger printer service for label
- Endpoint for reprinting AWB labels from completed tab

---

## 🖥️ Replit Tasks

1. Build `Packing.vue` with tab layout: Packing Queue, Pack Orders, Completed
2. Implement scan logic for SKU and Tote IDs
3. Integrate auto-printing on final item scan
4. Create visual component for packing drawer (used in Packing Queue tab)
5. Completed tab must include manual reprint button
6. Add scan focus reset after packing completes
