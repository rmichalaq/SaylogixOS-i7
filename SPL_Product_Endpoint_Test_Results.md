## üìù Analysis

The product-specific endpoint `FullNAByShortAddressforSaylogix` returns a **404 error**, indicating that:

1. **The product path does not exist** on the SPL API server
2. **The endpoint may not be activated yet** for the Saylogix subscription
3. **The path format might be incorrect**

## üéØ Comparison with Working Endpoint

### Working Endpoint (from investigation):
```
https://apina.address.gov.sa/NationalAddress/NationalAddressByShortAddress
```
- This endpoint works and has successful calls (2 out of 30)
- Returns proper address data when NAS code exists

### Product Endpoint (tested):
```
https://apina.address.gov.sa/NationalAddress/FullNAByShortAddressforSaylogix
```
- Returns 404 - Resource not found
- Does not appear to be available

## üí° Recommendations

1. **Continue using the standard endpoint** (`NationalAddressByShortAddress`) in production
2. **Contact SPL support** to verify if the product-specific endpoint needs activation
3. **Do not modify production code** to use the product endpoint until it's confirmed working
4. **Monitor the SPL dashboard** to see if calls to the standard endpoint are being tracked under the "Products" tab

## üõ°Ô∏è Production Safety

- ‚úÖ Test was conducted in isolation without affecting production
- ‚úÖ No changes were made to the main SPL service
- ‚úÖ No orders or verified addresses were affected
- ‚úÖ Test endpoint is clearly marked as "DO NOT USE IN PRODUCTION"

## üìä Current Production Status

The production system continues to use:
- **Endpoint**: `https://apina.address.gov.sa/NationalAddress/NationalAddressByShortAddress`
- **Success Rate**: Low (2/30) due to testing with non-existent NAS codes
- **Implementation**: Correct format with all required parameters

## Next Steps

1. Use real NAS codes that exist in the Saudi Post database for testing
2. Wait for SPL to confirm product endpoint activation
3. Continue monitoring success rates with the standard endpoint
